The main catalog was done at species-level (95% nucleotide identity) and
includes 302,655,267 unigenes. Additionally, we make available a 100%
non-redundant catalog (including 966,108,540 genes) and a 90% amino-acid level
catalog (210,478,083 genes). Note that the 90% catalog is a subcatalog of the
main one and identifiers are kept consistent.

## Habitat-specific catalogs

The 14 habitats considered in this version of the catalog give rise to 14
different sub-catalogs. Additionally, for convenience, we provide versions
which exclude rare genes and may be more appropriate for uses such as short
read mapping.

## Clusters

### ORF clustering table

This table shows the structure of the clusters at at 95%. Note that this table
requires _ca._ 300 GB to store and contains .... rows. To understand it, you also
need to download the renaming table.

### Cluster table

The protein-level (90% amino-acid identity) catalog and gene families were
built from clustering the 95\% unigenes.
